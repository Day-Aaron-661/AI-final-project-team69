Don't you see how I fight it
Trying to hide from a life of real pain
Maybe time has allowed it
Feeling the feel when I'm hearing your name 
Cos you decide how I survive
Do you realise inside oh

Just how much it's killing me



I'm just caught in the middle of you

Play my heart with a little bit of

Dangerous love

And I really want to be free

Got me caught and I'm living in a low life world

It's your unoriginality that's killing me

I've just got to be free



Now tell me what you want from me

Again and again you pretend it's alright

I'm feeling now that I can breathe

Can't comprehend how you can't recognise



Cos time can't change the way I feel

And you will find that I'm gonna be

More than you'll ever let me be



I'm just caught in the middle of you

Play my heart with a little bit of

Dangerous love

And I really want to be free

Got me caught and I'm living in a low life world

It's your unoriginality that's killing me

I've just got to be free



Free to disown you

Cos I thought that I told you

You been treating me badly

And you misappreciate my love

I'm trying to breathe

But it's killing me slowly

And you started to break me

With your dangerous love



Got to

Got to be fee...



I'm just caught in the middle of you

Play my heart with a little bit of

Dangerous love

And I really want to be free

Got me caught and I'm living in a low life world

It's your unoriginality that's killing me

I've just got to be free
