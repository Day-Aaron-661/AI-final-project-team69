This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow the rules when the set commands ya
They said it was blue
When the boold was red

That's is how you got a bullet blasted through your head



Blasted through your head

Blasted through your head



I give a shout out to the living dead

Who stood and watched at the feds cold centralized

So serene on the screen

You was mesmerized

Cellular phones soundin' a death tone

Corporations cold

Turn ya to stone before you realize



They load the clip in omnicolor

They pack the 9, they fire it at prime time

Sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz

And mutha fuckas lost their minds



Just victims of the in-house drive-by

They say jump, you say how high



They load the clip in omnicolor

They pack the 9, they fire it at prime time

Sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz

And mutha fuckas lost their minds



No escape from the mass mind rape

Play it again jack and then rewind the tape

Play it again and again and again

Until ya mind is locked in

Believin' all the lies that they are tellin' ya

Buying all the products that they are selling ya

They say jump

Ya say how high

Ya brain dead 

Ya gotta fuckin' bullet in your head



Just victims of the in-house drive-by

They say jump, you say how high



Ya standin' in line

Believin' the lies

Ya bowin' down to the flag

Ya got a fuckin' bullet in ya head
