Life
Has a funny way of trying to make
You a certain type
And making it hard
Yeah life
Is feet firmly on the ground

With a fear of flying

It's always too far 



It only makes me stronger

When you say I can't do it

I'll work that bit harder

When you say it's not within my grip

The barriers, I'll break them down

I'll prove myself, I'll stick around

I'll get through it all somehow

Nothing's unreachable



Life

Is full of all these empty words

In perfect rhyme

When they don't make no sense

Resigned

To all of these doubts and nerves

You want first place

But you take second best



It only makes me stronger

When you say I won't succeed

I'll work that bit harder

When you say you see no strength in time

The barriers, I'll break them down

I'll prove myself, I'll stick around

I'll get through it all somehow

Nothing's unreachable



Oh it's just a state of mind

If you set yourself up to fall

You'll never get there at all

All you've got to do is rise

It takes more to break me than a wave or two

Whatever's sent to test me

Gonna make it through



It only makes me stronger

When you say I can't do it

I'll work that bit harder

When you say it's not within my grip

The barriers, I'll break them down

I'll prove myself, I'll stick around

I'll get through it all somehow

Nothing's unreachable



Don't hide

Don't cover up what fuels you

Deep inside

It carries you on

Go find

That dream you dreamt about

Each and every night

Before it's gone



Cos you don't understand how I feel

You don't understand this is real

It's life



Yeah it's life

It's gone
