A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on , passed on and passed on
A world of violent rage
But it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip

I tried to grip my family

But I slipped

To escape from the pain and an existance mundane

I gotta 9, a sign, a set and now I gotta name





Read my writing on the wall

No one is here to catch me when I fall

But death is on my side

Suicide



A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home

Hatred passed on , passed on and passed on

A world of violent rage

But it's one that I can recognize

Having never seen the color of my father's eyes

Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip

I tried to grip my family

But I slipped

To escape from the pain and an existance mundane

I gotta 9, a sign, a set and now I gotta name



Read my writing on the wall

No one is here to catch me when I fall

Caught between the culture and the system

Genocide



Read my writing on the wall

No one is here to catch me if I fall

If ignorance is bliss

Then knock the smile of my face



If we don't take action now 

We settle for nothing later

We'll settle for nothing now

And we'll settle for nothing later
