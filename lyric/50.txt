I know you know every desperado and Sharp Shooter in the West.
You say that I can't see behind the mask,
Of those who call themselves the Good Guys in this,
Who take and take "So are you with me or not,"
You say, "This time... decide..."

Balmy days sweet sangria,

She's been gone have you seen her,

Senorita, shyly turning away,

Leaving me our fading flame.

Yeah you think about that.





What you believe in, it matters now to you and me.

What you believe in, I'm takin' in.

I said I'm takin' in what you believe in.

It matters now to you and me.





Before sundown the Mexicans leave San Antone.

The car will then drop him at the Border the breaking point.

I know your people have suffered time and time again.

But what about, I ask you now, the innocents on both sides.





Balmy days sweet sangria,

She's been gone have you seen her,

Senorita, shyly turning away,

Leaving me your fading flame.

Yeah you think about that. 



What you believe in, it matters now to you and me.

What you believe in 'cause I'm takin' in.

You say I'm takin' in what you Believe in.

It matters now to you and me.





So give me, give me, give me a no window.

I ask you, give me, give me, give me a Bloodless Road.

Tell me, tell me, tell me why does,

Does someone have to, have to, have to lose...?
