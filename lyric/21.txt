Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list 
All live, never on a floppy disk 
Inka, inka, bottle of ink 
Paintings of rebellion 
Drawn up by the thoughts I think 


It's set uplike a deck of cards 

They're sending us to early graves 

For all the diamonds 

They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades 

With poetry I paint the pictures that hit 

More than the murals that fit 

Don't turn away 

Get in front of it 



Chorus: 

Brotha did ya frget my name 

Did ya lose it on the wall 

Playin' tic-tac-toe 



Yo, check the diagonal 

Three brothers gone 

Come on 

Doesn't that make it three in a row 

Anger is a gift 



Chorus 



Yo, check the diagonal 

Three million gone 

Come on 

'Cause ya know they're counting backwards to zero 



Environment 

The environment exceeding on the level 

Of our unconsciousness 

For example 

What does the billboard say 

Come and play, come and play 

Forget about the movement 

Anger is a gift 



Freedom, freedom, yea right
