I see you floating it constantly
You're making me feel like you and I could be real
But then you're flipping the game
You walk away and turn your back baby
Stop treading on me baby 
Cos I'm mystified

And you know I've tried

I just can't get through to you



Chorus

What you gonna do

I don't know

What you gonna say

I ain't sure

Always the same

All the time

Every day

Played my mind

I can't keep wasting my time on your game 



Ain't no doubt about it x4



I've taken all that I can

I've given to you my all

But you don't seem to respond baby

Oh I can't stand all this waiting

Cos I can't stand all this waiting

Cos my patience is fading

Pretty soon I'll be gone



Let's rectify it

You can't deny it

The way that you feel for me

Tell me



Repeat Chorus



I can't keep wasting my time on your game



No more, no more

No more wasted time

Playing your game

I've seen this all before

Time and time, no way



Cos I'm mystified

You know that I've tried

I just can't get through to you



Repeat Chorus x2



I can't keep wasting my time on your game



No more, no more

No more wasted time

Playing your game

I've seen this all before

Time



Ain't no doubt about it x4
