If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slips away
Cos your baby is so far away
And there's a rose in a fisted glove

And the eagle flies with the dove

And if you can't be with the one you love honey

Love the one you're with



Don't be angry, don't be sad

Don't sit crying over good times you had

There's a girl right next to you

And she's just waiting for something to do



And there's a rose in a fisted glove

And the eagle flies with the dove

And if you can't be with the one you love honey

Love the one you're with



Turn your heartache right into joy

She's a girl and you're a boy

So get it together make it nice

And you won't need anymore advice 



And there's a rose in a fisted glove

And the eagle flies with the dove

And if you can't be with the one you love honey

Love the one you're with
