Carbon made, found her at the end of a chain,
"Time to race" she said, "race the downhill." 
Behind crystaline irises loons can dive, 
where the world bleeds white. 
Just keep... your eyes on her.

Keep... don't look away...

Keep... your eyes on her horizon.





Bear Claw, Free Fall, a Gunner's View,

Black and blue, shred in ribbons of lithium,

Blow by blow her mind cut in sheets,

Layers deep now unravelling.





Just keep... your eyes on her.

Keep... don't look away...

Keep... your eyes on her horizon.





Get me Neil on the line- no, I can't hold.

Have him read Snow Glass Apples, 

Where nothing is what it seems.

"Little Sis you must crack this," he says to me,

"You must go in again, carbon made only wants to be unmade."

Blade to ice it's Double Diamond time.





And keep... your eyes on her.

Keep... don't look away.

Keep... your eyes on her horizon,

Her eyes on her horizon.
