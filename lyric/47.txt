Ah... ah... ah... Ah... ah... ah...
Ah... ah... ah... Ah... ah... ah...
Not sayin' not charmed at all.
Not sayin' that you weren't worth the fall.
But I was alone when I knew it was real,
Down the canyon when I knew I had come,

To the line, through the dawn, to the light,

To the turn when you said you could drive all night,

Drive all night.



So I let Crazy take a spin.

Then I let Crazy settle in.

And kicked off my shoes, shut Reason out,

He said, "First let's just unzip your religion down."





Ah... ah... ah... Ah... ah... ah...

Found that I, I craved at all.

Saw me melt into your native shelter,

Where you carved my name.

Paper tigers scare and came,

Alive, through the dawn, to the light. 

To the turn when you said you could drive all night,

Drive all night.





So I let Crazy take a spin.

Then I let Crazy settle in.

And kicked off my shoes, shut Reason out,

He said, "First let's just unzip your religion down."

So I let Crazy pull me in.

Then I let Crazy take his spin.

And kicked off my shoes, shut Reason out,

He said, "First let's just unzip your religion down."

Heard that you were once "Temptation's girl..."





And as soon as you have rearranged the mess in your head,

He will show up looking sane, perfectly sane, if I know Crazy.
