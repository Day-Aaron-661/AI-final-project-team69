Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
A silent play on the shadow of power

A spectacle monopolized

The cameras eyes on choice disguised



Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil

Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?

Yes, a spectacle monopolized

They hold the reins, stole your eyes

All the Fist-a-gons, the bullets, and bombs

Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks

More for Gore or the son of a drug lord

None of the above. Fuck it, cut the cord!



Lights out! Guerrilla radio!

Turn that shit up!

Lights out! Guerrilla radio!

Turn that shit up!

Lights out! Guerrilla radio!

Turn that shit up!

Lights out! Guerrilla radio!



Contact, I hijacked the frequencies

Blockin' the beltway, move on DC!

Way past the days of bombin' MCs'

Sound off, Mumia go on be free!

Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file

All you pendejos know the trial was vile

An army of pigs try to silence my style

Off 'em all out that box, it's my radio dial!



Lights out! Guerrilla radio!

Turn that shit up!

Lights out! Guerrilla radio!

Turn that shit up!

Lights out! Guerrilla radio!

Turn that shit up!

Lights out! Guerrilla radio!

Turn that shit up!



It has to start somewhere

It has to start sometime

What better place than here?

What better time than now?



All hell can't stop us now

All hell can't stop us now

All hell can't stop us now

All hell can't stop us now

All hell can't stop us now

All hell can't stop us now
