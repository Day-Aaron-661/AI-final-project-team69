Strange- thought I knew you well.
Thought I had read the sky.
Thought I had read a change in your eyes.
So strange- woke up to a world that I am not a part,
Except when I can play its stranger.

After all, what were you really looking for.

And I wonder 'when will I learn blue isn't red,'

Everybody knows this.

And 'I wonder when will I learn,'

'When will I learn,'

Guess I was in deeper than I thought I was

If I have enough love for the both of us





"Just stay," you say, "we'll build a nest." 

So I left my life, tried on your friends,

Tried on your opinions. 

So when the bridges froze and you did not come home,

I put our snowflake under a microscope.





After all what was I really looking for.

And I wonder 'when will I learn.'

Maybe my wish knew better than I did.

And I wonder 'when will I learn, when will I learn,'

Guess I was in Deeper than I thought I was,

If I have enough love for the both of us.





So strange- now I'm finally in, the Party has begun.

It's not like I can't feel you still.

But strange- what I will leave behind.

You call me one more time but now I must be leaving.
