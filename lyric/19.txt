Silence
Something about silence makes me sick
'Cause silence can be violent 
Sorta like a slit wrist
If the vibe was suicide

Then you would push da button

But if ya bowin' down 

Then let me do the cuttin'



Some speak with sounds

But speak in silent voices

Like radio is silent 

Though it fills the air with noises

Its transmission brings submission

As ya mold to the unreal

Mad boy grips the microphone

Wit' a fistful of steel



Chorus:

Fistful of steel

Fistful of steel

Fistful of steel

Fistful of steel



Yes, it's time to flow like the fluids in ya veins

If ya will it, I will spill it

And ya out just as quick as ya came

Not a silent one

But a defiant one

Never a normal one

'Cause I'm that bastard son

With the visions of the move

Vocals not to sooth

But to ignite and put in flight

My sence of militance

Groovin', playin' this game called survival

Status the elite, the enemy, the rival

The silentsheep slippin', riffin', trippin'

Give ya a glimpse of the reality I'm grippin'

Steppin into the jam and I'm slammin' like Shaquille

Mad boy grips the microphone

Wit' a fistful of steel



Chorus



A 44 full of bullets

Face full of pale

Eyes full of empty

A stare full of nails

The roulette ball rolls alone on the wheel

A mind full of fire

And a fistful of steel



If the vibe was suicide

Then you would push da button

But if ya bowin' down

Then let me do the cuttin'
