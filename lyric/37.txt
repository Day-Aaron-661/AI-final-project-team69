all the days we've been togetherall the days we've been apartadd up a bunch of nothingif i'm not still in your hearti never want you to bejust a page in my historysomeone i used to loveyour voice breathed in my earor on the telephoneall the tender things we've whisperedto keep from feeling alonemay they never come to bejust cold gems set in memoryof someone i used to lovethis current flows between usthat will not be deniedyou draw me in towards youlike the moon pulls at the tidemay no shadow ever fall that will make me have to callyou someone i used to love
