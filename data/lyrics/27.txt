People get the wrong impression
I wonder if they change their minds
It's an understated sign
Tell me how you see me again 
Now we're swinging to the time
It's a meeting of the minds

It's all unbelievable

Look to play it how we say it

If you're meaning to delay it

Hang on

Cos we're moving all around



It's up when the party's over

And we want to free our minds

Now I'm telling you there's no hurry

Cos we're choosing to groove

It's so cool to dance the night way



I choose to live a good life

Have a good time and enjoy the ride

Turn it up, break it down, move on

High times took a good turn

Spinning it around cos you gotta learn

To rectify, justify this song



Now we're swinging to the time

It's a meeting of the minds

It's all unbelievable

Look to play it how we say it

If you're meaning to delay it

Hang on

Cos we're moving all around



It's up when the party's over

And we want to free our minds

Now I'm telling you there's no hurry

Cos we're choosing to groove

It's so cool to dance the night way

It's up when the party's over

And we want to free our minds

Now I'm telling you there's no hurry

Cos we're choosing to groove

It's so cool to dance the night way

It's up when the party's over

And we want to free our minds

Now I'm telling you there's no hurry

Cos we're choosing to groove

It's so cool to dance the night way
