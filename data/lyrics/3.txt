A-FEEL THE FUNK BLAST!!

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out, yo, yo, yo



[Zack de la Rocha]

I be walkin' god like a dog, my narrative, fearless

My word war returns to burn like Baldwin home from Paris

Like Steel from a furnace, I was born landless

This is the native son, born of Zapata's guns

Stroll through the shanties and the cities remains

Same bodies buried hungry but with different last names

These vultures rob everything leave nothing but chains

Pick a point on the globe! Yes, the pictures the same

There's a bank, there's a church, a myth and a hearse

A mall and a loan, a child dead at birth

There's a widow pig parrot, a rebel to tame

A white-hooded judge, a syringe and a vein

....and the riot be the rhyme of the unheard..



[Hook]

WHAT YA SAY, WHAT YA SAY, WHAT YA SAY, WHAT?!

WHAT YA SAY, WHAT YA SAY, WHAT YA SAY, WHAT?!

WHAT YA SAY, WHAT YA SAY, WHAT YA SAY, WHAT?!

I'm Calm Like A Bomb!

This ain't subliminal, feel the critical mass approach horizon

The pulse of the condemned, sound off America's demise

The anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, yes I spit fire

Hope lies in the smoldering rubble of empires

Yes back through the shanties and the cities remains

The same bodies buried hungry, but with different last names

These vultures rob everyone, leave nothing but chains

Pick a point here at home, yes the picture's the same

There's a field full of slaves, some corn and some debt

There's a ditch full of bodies, the check for the rent

There's a tap, the phone, the silence of stone

The numb black screen that be feelin' like home

..And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard..

There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill

There's a country's soul that reads post no bills

There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill

There's a right to obey and there's a right to kill

There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill

There's a country's soul that reads post no bills

There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill

There's a right to obey and there's a right to kill
