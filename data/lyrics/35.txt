i was half asleep in the washroom when they came ineyes like moonlight on barbed wire and veins showing under the skinthe uniforms made me nervous, i got ready for the chasebut they left me scanning these crowds for some signs of your facesomething fell in Saskatchewan in 1885where is it now that we need it, in this century of jive?the axe falls as if through water - never leaves a traceand i'm scanning these crowds for some sign of your facethe world shot down love like a spy, once upon a time agonow people stand around here, like crows in the snowlike the shadow of the rope on Louis Ri√©l, they look so clean out of placeand i'm scanning these crowds for some sign of your facethough storms may still kiss the grasslands with primal firein the land of passive revolution, everything's for hireare they demons, are they lemmings, or just the humans in this place?Lord, i'm scanning these crowds for some sign of your face
