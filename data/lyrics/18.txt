Although ya try to iscredit
Ya still never edit
The needle, I'll thread it
Radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double, I'm mad

Still knee-deep in the system's shit

Hoover, he was a body remover

I'll give ya a dose

But it'll never come close

To the rage built up inside of me

Fist in the air, in the land of hypocrisy



Movements come and movements go

Leaders speak, movements cease

When theirheads are flown

'Cause all these punks

Got bullets in their heads

Department of police, the judge, the feds

Networks at work, keepin' people calm



You know they went after King

When he spoke out on Vietnam

He turned the power to the have-nots

And then came the shot



Wit' poetry, my mind I flex

Flip like Wilson, vocals never lackin' dat fitnesse

Whadda I have to do to wake you up

To shake you up, to break the structure up

'Cause this blood still floods in the gutter

I'm like talkin' photos

Mad boy kicks open the shutter

Set the groove

Then I stick and move like I was Cassius

Rep the stutter step

Then bomb a left upon the facists

Yea, the several federal men

Who pulled schemes on the dream

And put it to an end



Ya better beware

Of retribution with mind war

20/20 visions and murals with metaphors



The networks at work, keepin' people calm

Ya know they murdered X

And tried to blame it on Islam

He turned the power to the have-nots

And then came the shot



What was the price on his head
