some people get to make the newssome people get to say what's trueeverybody's got to find their own way throughbut if you love love, then love loves you toosome people get to fly by nightsome people get to shine a lighteverybody's got to find their own way throughbut if you love love, then love loves you toosome of us hunger for the finer thingssome lust for power like the ancient kingssome have to leave behind everthing they thought they knewsome people don't know how much trouble they can brewsome take the burden of another's painsome spend forever for a moment's gaineverybody's got to find their own way throughbut if you love love, then love loves you toobut if you love love, then love loves you too
