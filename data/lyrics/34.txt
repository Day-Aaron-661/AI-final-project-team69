there's a bone in my earkeeps singing your namesometimes it's like pleasuresometimes it's like painit's a small voice and quietbut i hear it plainthere's a bone in my earkeeps singing your namein my heart there's an imagelike looking through glasscould be looking at mecould be looking right pasti don't like it wheni can't tell which is truebut i wouldn't trade the worldfor that picture of youmoon in the watercold lights in the streetswarmth in your fingerssweat in your sheetslaid out like an offeringwhere two currents meetthe river is darkbut the water is sweetwailing on the mountainsmoke on the windcan't drown out the whisperor the scent of your skindon't know where it came frombut i know where it camethere's a bone in my earkeeps singing your name
