All you have to do is think about it
Baby...you drive me crazy all the time
When you play me
I'm burning with the lies that you feed me
Chasing my despair
I can see you smiling till I'm over the edge



Do yourself a favour

Realise you win every game

Cos it's plain to see that I'm a mouse of a man



Yeah get me out of my mind

I don't feel so good

Breaking down the walls

While I'm falling apart

Get me out of my mind

I don't feel so good



Try to understand



Lately

You reply with your lies that I'm failing

You leave me high and dry

Over over over

You trip me around



I tell you baby

Do yourself a favour

Realise you win every game

Cos it's plain to see that I'm a mouse of a man

Yeah you made a mouse of a man



Yeah get me out of my mind

I don't feel so good

Breaking down the walls

While I'm falling apart

Get me out of my mind

I don't feel so good



Try to understand that I'm losing my heart



Yeah get me out of my mind

I don't feel so good

Breaking down the walls

While I'm falling apart

Get me out of my mind

I don't feel so good



Try to think about it

Let's think about it



All you ever do is think about it 



Breaking it to you 



Cos you've got to

Get me out of my mind

Breaking down the walls

I'm falling apart

Get me out of my mind

Try to understand that I'm losing my heart



Try to understand

Think about it
