Rebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait
Come on, seein'what's at stake

Action for reaction

If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state

Get a check-up

This is a stick-up

Our freedom or your life

Lord I wish I could be peaceful

But there can be no sequel



Now freedom must be fundamental

In Johannesburg or South Central

On the mic, 'cause someoneshould tell 'em

To kick in the township rebellion



Yea, so you thought you could get with the hardlines

That fill your mind

The thoughts, battles fought

And lessons taught

And I'll display the fitness

And flip like a gymnast

Raise my fist and resist

Asleep, though we stand in the midst

Of the war

Gotta get mine

Gotta get more

Keepin' the mic warm against the norm

'Cause what does it offer me

I think often it's nothin' but a coffin



Gotta get wreck

'Til our necks never swing on a rope

From here to the cape of no hope



Now freedom must be fundamental

In Johannesburg or South Central

On the mic, 'cause someoneshould tell 'em

To kick in the township rebellion



Why stand

On a silent platform

Fight the war

Fuck the norm
