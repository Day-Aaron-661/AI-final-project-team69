Every official that comes in 
Cripples us leaves us maimed
Silent and tamed
And with our flesh and bones
He builds his homes

Southern fist

Rise through tha jungle mist

Clenched to smash power so cancerous

A black flag and a red star

A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles

'Cause for Raza livin in La La

Is like Gaza on to tha dawn of Intifada

Reach for tha lessons tha masked pass on

And seize tha metropolis 

It's you that it's built on



Everything can change on a new years day

As everything changed on new years day



Everything can change on a new years day

As everything changed on new years day



War within a breath

It's land or death

Their existence is a crime

Their seat their robe their tie

Their land deeds

Their hired guns

They're tha crime

Shots heard underground round tha rapture

Tha world's eye captured

At last in a Mexican pasture

Tha masked screaming land or death 

Within a breath

A war from tha depth of time

Who shot four puppet governors in a line

Who shook all tha world bankers

Who think they can rhyme

Shot tha landlords who knew it was mine

Yes a war from tha depth of time



Everything can change on a new years day

As everything changed on new years day



Everything can change on a new years day

As everything changed on new years day



War within a breath

It's land or death
