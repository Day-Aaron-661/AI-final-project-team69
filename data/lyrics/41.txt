chorus:tie me at the crossroads when i diehang me in the wind 'til i get good and dryand the kids that pass can scratch their headsand say "who was that guy?"tie me at the crossroads when i dielooking outward see what you can seeby the time you look at something it's already historyas the echoes of our passing fade, all there is to sayis,"you know i loved you all in my particular way"chorusit's more blessed to give than it is to receiveexcept when it comes to free advice i believehere i go anyway, back seat driving tonightmove fast, stay cool, keep your eye on the front sightchorus
