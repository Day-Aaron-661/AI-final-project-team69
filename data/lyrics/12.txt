It's just another bombtrack 
And suckas be thinkin' that they can fade it 
But I'm going to drop it at a higher level 
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down 
Hand out some beat-downs 
Cold runna train on punk ho's that 

Think they run the game 

But I learned to burn that bridge and delete 

Those who compete at a level that's obsolete 

Instead I warm my hands on the flames of the flag 

As I recall our downfall 

And the business' that burned us all 

See through the news and views that twist reality 

Enough 

I call the bluff 

Manifest destiny 



Landlords and power whores 

On my people they took turns 

Dispute the suits I ignite 

And then watch 'em burn 



The thoughts of a militant mind 

Hardline, hardline after hardline 



Landlords and power whores 

On my people they took turns 

Dispute the suits I ignite 

And then watch 'em burn 





Chorus: 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn 



Another funky radical bombtrack 

Started as a sketch in my notebook 

But now dope hooks make punks take another look 

My thoughts youhear and you begin to fear 

That ya card will get pulled if you interfere 

With the thoughts of a militant mind 

Hardline, hardline after hardline 



Landlords and power whores 

On my people they took turns 

Dispute the suits I ignite 

And then watch 'em burn 



Chorus
