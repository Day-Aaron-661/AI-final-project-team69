It's not the laughter of rain in the drainIt's not the laughter of a man in painIt's not the laughter you can hide behindIt's not the laughter of a frightened mindBalanced on the brink only waiting for a shoveYou better listen for the laugh of loveIt's not the laughter of the gloating richIt's not the laughter of the sacred bitchIt's not the laughter of the macho foolIt's not the laughter that obeys the rulesMore of a chain saw in a velvet gloveYou better listen for the laugh of loveIt's not the laughter of a child with toysIt's not the laughter of the president's boysIt's not the laughter of the media kingThis laughter doesn't sell you anythingIt's the wind in the wings of a diving doveYou better listen for the laugh of loveWhatever else you might be thinking ofYou better listen for the laugh of love
