there you goswimming deeper into mysteryhere i remainonly seeing where you used to bestared at the ceiling'til my ears filled up with tearsnever got to know yousuddenly you out of heregone from mystery into mysterygone from daylight into nightanother step deeper into darknesscloser to the lightwalked outsidesummer moon was nearly downmist on the fieldsholy stillness all arounddeath's no strangerno stranger than the life i've seenstill i crystill i begged to get you back againgone from mystery into mysterygone from daylight into nightanother step deeper into darknesscloser to the light
