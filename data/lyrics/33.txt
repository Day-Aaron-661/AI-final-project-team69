the hills are full of secretsowls watch by nightdown in town the bars are fulland the drunks are picking fightsthese are things i knowbut the facts are filtered throughall the ways i want you2:19 freight trainmoaning somewhere neari see you in the distancebut i can't get there from herehard to believe it's happeningbut my whole world shrunken toall the ways i want youstars look down and laugh at mei ought to take a bowdon't have to tell themlife's hard sometimesthere's one falling nownobody's here beside mei can talk about it toall the ways i want you
