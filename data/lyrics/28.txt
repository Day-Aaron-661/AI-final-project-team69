You run, you run
But this ain't living
You wish you could go back
And begin it all over
But it's over 
You fight, you fight

You just keep saying

You'll feel better come sooner or later

In no time

It's been a long time



You still got made to turn it

You still got made to lift you up 



You got wings

But you can't fly

You got so much pain inside

You're very kind

In your dreams you're so high

But you don't live that in your life

You're very kind

You're so kind



You do, you do

You love me baby

I can't fight when you leave me lazy

With your doubts, your doubts



You try and you try

And there's no winner

You give, give more

But it just gets harder

In your mind

We all try



You still got time to turn it

You still got made to lift you up 



You got wings

But you can't fly

You got so much pain inside

You're very kind

In your dreams you're so high

But you don't live that in your life

You're very kind

You're so kind



You believe you're not good enough

It fills your mind

Plays

It's in the way of you and I

I'd say a thousand times

I know you're one of a kind

You're so kind



You got wings

But you can't fly

You got so much pain inside

You're very kind

In your dreams you're so high

But you don't live that in your life

You're very kind

You're so kind



You got wings

But you can't fly

You got so much pain inside

You're very kind

In your dreams you're so high

But you don't live that in your life

You're very kind

You're so kind



You got wings
