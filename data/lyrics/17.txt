Huh!
Yeah, we're comin' back in with another "Bombtrack"
Think ya know it's all of that, HUH!
Hey yo, so check this out...
Yeah...
Know your enemy!

Come on!



Born with insight and a raised fist

A witness to the slit wrist

As we move into '92

Still in a room without a view

Ya gotta know

Ya gotta know

That when I say go, go, go

Amp up and amplify

Defy

I'm a brother with a furious mind

Action must be taken

We don't need the key

We'll break in



Something must be done

About vengeance, a badge and a gun

'Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system

I was born to rage against 'em



Fist in ya face, in the place

And I'll drop the style clearly

Know your enenmy



Word is born

Fight the war, fuck the norm

Now I got no patience

So sick of complacence

With the D E F I A N C E

The mind of a revolutionary

So clear the lane

The finger to the land of chains

What? The land of the free?

Whoever told you that is your enemy



Something must be done

About vengeance, a badge and a gun

'Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system

I was born to rage against 'em



Now action must be taken

We don't need the key

We'll break in



I've got no patience now

So sick of complacence now

I've got no patience now

So sick of complacence now

Sick of sick of sick of sick of sick of you

Time has come to pay



Yes I know my enemies

They are the teachers who taught me to fight me

Compromise, conformity, assimulation, submission

Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite

All of which are American dreams
